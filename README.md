# Custom Array Methods

The repository is a just a fun little project to recreate the built in Array methods added to JS in ES6.

The primary purpose of this project is to practice Typescript and TDD, with the Array methods just providing the context for the code.

To recreate this project, clone the repository with `git clone` and install dependencies with `npm i`.

Tests can be ran with `npm run test` with the option `-t` flag for specific tests, for example `npm run test -t map` to run the tests included in `map.spec.ts`
